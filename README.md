8 puzzle game

## Description:

In this assignment, you will implement 4 functions related to search problem formulation for 8-puzzle game. In the template file itcs451-hw1.py, you will see "# TODO: " from 1 to 4. You can read the function documentation for what you need to do in detail. Here is a summary:

1. initializeState(): create and return a state in 8-puzzle game.

2. successor(): take an action and return a resulting state after performing an action to the current state (self).

3. is_goal(): check if the current state is the same as the goal board.

4. trace(): return a path (list of nodes) from the root to the current node (including the current node). This will be helpful later when we want to get the "solution" after we've don searching.
